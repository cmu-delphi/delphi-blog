&lt;p&gt;One of our primary initiatives at the Delphi COVIDcast project
has been to curate a diverse set of COVID-related data streams,
and to make them freely available through our
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html&#34;&gt;COVIDcast Epidata API&lt;/a&gt;.
These include both novel signals that we have collected and analyzed ourselves,
such as our symptom survey &lt;a href=&#34;https://delphi.cmu.edu/blog/2020/08/26/covid-19-symptom-surveys-through-facebook/&#34;&gt;distributed by Facebook&lt;/a&gt;
to its users, &lt;a href=&#34;https://delphi.cmu.edu/blog/2020/09/18/covid-19-symptom-surveys-through-google/&#34;&gt;Google’s symptom survey&lt;/a&gt; whose results are delivered to us,
the percentage of doctor’s visits due to COVID-like illness,
and results from Quidel’s antigen tests;
and also existing signals, such as the confirmed case counts
and deaths reported by USA Facts and Johns Hopkins University.
The COVIDcast API freely provides researchers and decision-makers
with the data they need to conduct their work, and
is conveniently accessible via easy-to-use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcast-py/html/&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; packages.&lt;/p&gt;
