&lt;p&gt;One of our primary initiatives at the Delphi COVIDcast project
has been to curate a diverse set of COVID-related data streams,
and to make them freely available through our
&lt;a href=&#34;https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html&#34;&gt;COVIDcast API&lt;/a&gt;.
These include both novel signals that we have collected and analyzed ourselves,
such as our symptom survey &lt;a href=&#34;https://delphi.cmu.edu/blog/2020/08/26/covid-19-symptom-surveys-through-facebook/&#34;&gt;distributed by Facebook&lt;/a&gt;
to its users, &lt;a href=&#34;https://delphi.cmu.edu/blog/2020/09/18/covid-19-symptom-surveys-through-google/&#34;&gt;Google’s symptom survey&lt;/a&gt; whose results are delivered to us,
the percentage of doctor’s visits due to COVID-like illness,
and results from Quidel’s antigen tests;
and also existing signals, such as the confirmed case counts
and deaths reported by USA Facts and Johns Hopkins University.
The COVIDcast API freely provides researchers and decision-makers
with the data they need to conduct their work, and
is conveniently accessible via easy-to-use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcast-py/html/&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/&#34;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since April 2020, in collaboration with Facebook,
partner universities, and public health officials,
we’ve been conducting a massive daily survey to monitor
the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.
Our survey, advertised by Facebook, is taken by about 74,000 people each day.
Respondents provide information about COVID-related
symptoms, contacts, risk factors, and demographics,
allowing us to examine county-level trends across the US.
We believe that this combination of &lt;em&gt;detail&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;scale&lt;/em&gt;
has never before been available in a public health emergency.
In this post, we’ll share some of our initial survey findings,
show you how to access the data, and highlight
some of the exciting new directions that we’re pursuing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hello World!</title>

&lt;p&gt;Hello from the Delphi research group at Carnegie Mellon University!
We’re a group of faculty, students, and staff, based primarily out of CMU
together with strong collaborators from other universities and industry.
Our group was founded in 2012 to advance the theory and practice of epidemic
forecasting. Since March 2020, we have refocused efforts towards helping combat
the COVID-19 pandemic, by supporting informed decision-making at federal, state,
and local levels of government and in the healthcare sector. Until now, we’ve
been pretty “heads down” with our work, and slow to communicate what we’ve been
up to. But at last … Delphi finally has a blog! This first post serves as an
introduction of sorts. Future posts will dive deeper into our various projects.&lt;/p&gt;
