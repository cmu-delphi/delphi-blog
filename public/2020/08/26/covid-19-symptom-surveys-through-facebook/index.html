    <p>Since April 2020, in collaboration with Facebook,
partner universities, and public health officials,
we’ve been conducting a massive daily survey to monitor
the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.
Our survey is advertised through Facebook, but it’s run on our own Qualtrics
platform (Facebook never sees any of the survey responses).
This is an ongoing operation and our survey is taken by about 74,000 people
each day. Respondents provide information about COVID-related
symptoms, contacts, risk factors, and demographics,
allowing us to examine county-level trends across the US.
We believe that this combination of <em>detail</em> and <em>scale</em>
has never before been available in a public health emergency.</p>
<p>We make aggregated data publicly available daily through our
<a href="https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html">COVIDcast API</a>,
and visualize it on our <a href="https://covidcast.cmu.edu/">COVIDcast interactive map</a>.
We also make (fully de-identified) individual survey responses available
to researchers who agree to
<a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid-19-symptom-survey-request-for-data-access/">data use terms</a>.</p>
<p>In this post, we’ll explore some initial findings
from our analysis of two indicators of COVID-like illness
derived from our survey data.
We believe that this is just the tip of the iceberg
in demonstrating what these surveys have to offer,
and we’ll close the post by highlighting
some of the exciting new directions that we’re pursuing now.</p>
<div id="short-background" class="section level2">
<h2>Short Background</h2>
<p>Back in March 2020, we began discussions with Facebook about running a
survey, advertised through their site, to collect real-time,
county-level information on people experiencing COVID-like symptoms.
The basic premise was that we could use this information
to construct an early indicator of COVID activity in the US.
To be sure, we weren’t the first group
to think of running COVID-19 symptom surveys.
Several others had already been deployed,
including <a href="https://covidnearyou.org/">CovidNear You</a>
and <a href="https://covid.joinzoe.com/us-2">COVID Symptom Study</a>.
What differentiated our project was a commitment
to deploy a survey that could:
(a) grow to be truly massive in size;
and (b) be sustained at this size.
We quickly realized that these goals could only be achieved
with buy-in from a platform like Facebook.
Fortunately for us, they agreed!</p>
<p>We launched our survey on April 6, 2020.
Every day since, Facebook directs a random sample of its users
to our survey, hosted on <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/">Qualtrics</a>.
As part of our agreement with Facebook,
we receive the data directly from Qualtrics,
and Facebook never sees any of the survey responses.
We use the data only for research purposes,
and only aggregated data is ever released publicly,
with fully de-identified individual survey responses
available only to researchers who agree to our
<a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid-19-symptom-survey-request-for-data-access/">data use terms</a>.</p>
<p>As of this writing, our survey is taken by an average of 74,000 people per
day, delivering enough data for us to create meaningful estimates
for an average of nearly 1,000 counties per week.
Over the course of the survey so far, we have already collected over 10 million
responses! An <a href="https://covidmap.umd.edu/">international version of the survey</a>,
available in over 50 languages, was launched soon after by a team at the
University of Maryland.</p>
<p>Before going into detail later about our survey and our survey-based
indicators, here are a couple maps to ground your intuition.
On the left is a state-level heatmap of
the estimated percentage of people with COVID symptoms,
based on our survey, averaged over June 15 to July 15.
On the right is a heatmap of the number of
daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people,
based on data from <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">JHU CSSE</a>,
averaged over the same period.
We can see some clear similarities in the intensity patterns,
which already provides a nice sanity check.</p>

<div id="why-run-these-surveys" class="section level2">
<h2>Why Run These Surveys?</h2>
<p>Now let’s unpack the main motivation behind our survey a bit:
a person typically experiences COVID-like symptoms
before they seek medical care or a COVID-19 test,
so data on how many people are self-reporting COVID-like symptoms in a
given county could potentially give us an <strong>early indicator</strong>
of COVID activity in that county. And to be clear, it’s not just
<em>that</em> we’re looking at symptoms that’s important here,
it’s the <em>way</em> we’re measuring them:
since symptoms can be reported from home,
with no special equipment needed,
this data isn’t subject to the same reporting delays
as formal testing metrics like confirmed COVID-19 case counts.
(Note that confirmed COVID-19 case counts aren’t just delayed,
they are confounded by issues like testing policy and capacity,
while self-reported symptom data shouldn’t be subject to the same problems.
This is potentially a very important point, but much more subtle, and we
won’t delve into it in this post.)</p>
<p>It’s also worth being clear about what we’re <em>not</em> able to say with these
surveys:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Symptoms alone are not sufficient to diagnose coronavirus infections: of
course, COVID-like symptoms can be caused by other conditions, and many true
infections are asymptomatic. Therefore, even if we ignore the issues brought on
by self-reporting and survey sampling, we can’t expect the estimates we produce
to reflect the true rate of COVID-19 (and they’re not intended to).</p></li>
<li><p>Our survey responses come from the population of Facebook users in the US,
which may be a sizeable fraction of the US population, but certainly not all of
it. We’ll also likely see bias because some people on Facebook are more inclined
to take surveys than others. We attempt to correct for both of these biases
using a <a href="https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.html#survey-weighting">statistical reweighting
scheme</a>,
but these corrections aren’t perfect.</p></li>
<li><p>Our symptom data is entirely self-reported, in contrast to data
reported by medical professionals. Some fraction of the responses could be
erroneous, either because a person misunderstood the question or chose to answer
incorrectly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize, our survey can’t be used to make absolute statements about the
true prevalence of coronavirus disease in the US; in fact, it shouldn’t even be
regarded as a foolproof way of deriving unbiased estimates of the number of
people with COVID-19 <em>symptoms</em> in the US (mainly due to the self-reporting
aspect). Nevertheless, as we’ll see below, <em>changes in self-reported symptoms
over time</em> can still be a meaningful reflection of the changes in coronavirus
infections over time. And in the best case, it can help predict changes to come
some days into the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="whats-in-the-survey" class="section level2">
<h2>What’s in the Survey?</h2>
<p>Our survey has 4 sections and is about 35 questions long. The first section is
short and gathers information on a core set of symptoms used to define a
condition called <strong>COVID-like illness</strong> or <strong>CLI</strong>, which we define as <em>fever of
at least 100 °F, along with cough, shortness of breath, or difficulty
breathing</em>. This mirrors the standard definition of influenza-like illness or
ILI (defined as fever of at least 100 °F, along with sore throat or cough), and
is in line with the working definition of CLI used by the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
<p>Using data from responses to the survey’s first section, we can estimate two key
quantities, in a given location, on a given day:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>% CLI: the percentage of people with COVID-like illness; and</p></li>
<li><p>% CLI-in-community: the percentage of people who <em>know someone in their local
community</em> with COVID-like illness.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Details on how we compute the % CLI and % CLI-in-community estimates can be
found in our <a href="https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/fb-survey.html">COVIDcast signals
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The % CLI-in-community indicator has an interesting backstory: it was sort of a
“happy accident” from an experiment we tried with surveys we were running in
partnership with Google. (We’ll cover our Google survey in a future blog post.)
The preliminary results from this experiment were exciting enough that we
decided to add a similar question to our Facebook survey about a week after its
initial launch.</p>
<p>The second section of the survey goes into more detail on symptoms, testing, and
medical-seeking behavior. The third section gathers info on contacts and risk
factors, and the fourth section gathers info on demographics. These survey
questions provide a wealth of information that we haven’t fully tapped into (but
plan to soon—see the end of this blog post). To give credit where it’s due: it
was Facebook who initially suggested we run a longer survey with extensive
questions on contacts, risk factors, and demographics. At first, we wanted to
run a short survey with only the questions on COVID-like illness, and Facebook
gathered ideas for more questions from several different research groups in
public health. They assured us that lengthening the survey wouldn’t hurt the
completion rate too much, and they were right: of the people who complete the
first section, over 85% go on to finish the full survey!</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/symptom-survey/">survey documentation
site</a> includes more
details about the survey, including the <a href="https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/symptom-survey/coding.html">full text of every survey
version</a>.
And yes, researchers can <a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid-19-symptom-survey-request-for-data-access/">request
access</a>
to (fully de-identified) individual survey responses for research purposes,
provided they agree to keep data from individual respondents confidential.</p>

<div id="some-interesting-examples" class="section level2">
<h2>Some Interesting Examples</h2>
<p>Now we’ll turn to some interesting data examples that provide evidence
that our survey-based CLI signals can be early indicators of COVID activity.
We’ll consider the % CLI-in-community indicator, which tends to be more stable
than the % CLI indicator (which shows similar, but noisier, trends).
Let’s start by looking at Miami-Dade County,
which experienced a surge of new COVID-19 cases
between June and July: below we plot daily new confirmed COVID-19
cases over time (using a 7-day trailing average for smoothing) as a blue curve.
We also plot the % CLI-in-community indicator as a red curve.
Note that these two curves, case counts and % CLI-in-community,
are not measured in the same units, hence our use of two y-axes:
one on the left for case counts, and one on the right for % CLI-in-community.</p>

<p>This example, as with all code examples in this blog post, was produced using
our <a href="https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/">covidcast R package</a>.</p>
<p>A first glance reveals that the % CLI-in-community indicator
clearly rises alongside confirmed COVID-19 cases,
a reassuring sanity check: more people indeed report
that others are sick in their community at times
when COVID-19 tests confirm more cases.
But a closer look shows something quite interesting:
the % CLI-in-community signal begins to rise steeply on June 19
(first dashed vertical line), which happens <em>6 days before</em> COVID-19 cases
begin their steep ascent on June 25 (second dashed vertical line).</p>
<p>This is just one county; to investigate further, we pulled the 20 counties with
the biggest increase in new COVID-19 cases between June 1 and July 15, and made
the plots below, with COVID-19 cases in blue and the % CLI-in-community
indicator in red. We can see that the % CLI-in-community indicator is (a) never
lagging and (b) leading in many counties; for example, Dallas County, Orange
County, Hidalgo County, and Nueces County are a few notable examples.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>num = 20
geo_values = df_in %&gt;% group_by(geo_value) %&gt;%
  summarize(diff = last(value) - first(value)) %&gt;%
  arrange(desc(diff)) %&gt;% head(num) %&gt;% pull(geo_value)

p_list = vector(&quot;list&quot;, num)
for (i in 1:num) {
  p_list[[i]] = plot_one(geo_values[i], legend = FALSE)

<p>The examples above are an informal way of looking
at the <em>recall</em> of the % CLI-in-community signal.
Of course, this is only one half of the story:
for the signal to be a useful early indicator,
we’d also need to know something about its <em>precision</em>:
we’d need to know that % CLI-in-community seldom rises
in periods where new COVID-19 cases remain flat.
We save a formal precision-recall analysis for future work.</p>

<div id="basic-correlation-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Basic Correlation Analysis</h2>
<p>To complement the more exploratory, qualitative analysis of the last section,
we’ll conduct a simple quantitative analysis here,
by computing some basic measures of correlation
between our survey-based indicators and confirmed COVID-19 case rates.
There are a couple of ways to slice the data—by day and
by county—and we’ll consider both ways in what follows.</p>
<div id="correlations-sliced-by-time" class="section level3">
<h3>Correlations Sliced by Time</h3>
<p>First we compute, for each day between April 15 and August 15,
the Spearman correlation between the % CLI indicator and COVID-19 case rates,
across the counties that had at least 500 cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases.
(Spearman correlation assesses whether one variable is high when another is
high, even if their relationship is not linear.)
We do the same for the % CLI-in-community indicator,
and plot the results below, with the % CLI indicator correlations in
red, and the % CLI-in-community correlations in blue.
We can see clearly that the % CLI-in-community indicator produces,
consistently across all time, <em>much</em> higher correlations.
Even in an absolute sense, the correlations from the % CLI-in-community are
noteworthy: they reach over 0.8 for a period between July and August.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Fetch Facebook % CLI signal, % CLI-in-community signal and JHU confirmed case
# incidence proportions, all at the county level, over a long time period
start_day = &quot;2020-04-15&quot;
end_day = &quot;2020-08-15&quot;
df_fb1 = covidcast_signal(&quot;fb-survey&quot;, &quot;smoothed_cli&quot;,
                          start_day, end_day, geo_type = &quot;county&quot;)
df_fb2 = covidcast_signal(&quot;fb-survey&quot;, &quot;smoothed_hh_cmnty_cli&quot;,
                          start_day, end_day, geo_type = &quot;county&quot;)
df_in = covidcast_signal(&quot;jhu-csse&quot;, &quot;confirmed_7dav_incidence_prop&quot;,
                         start_day, end_day, geo_type = &quot;county&quot;)

# Consider only counties with at least 500 cumulative cases so far
case_num = 500
geo_values = covidcast_signal(&quot;jhu-csse&quot;, &quot;confirmed_cumulative_num&quot;,
                              max(df_in$time_value), max(df_in$time_value),
                              geo_type = &quot;county&quot;) %&gt;%
  filter(value &gt;= case_num) %&gt;% pull(geo_value)

df_fb2_act = df_fb2 %&gt;% filter(geo_value %in% geo_values)
df_in_act = df_in %&gt;% filter(geo_value %in% geo_values)

# Compute correlations, per time, over all counties
df_cor1 = covidcast_cor(df_fb1_act, df_in_act, by = &quot;time_value&quot;,
                        method = &quot;spearman&quot;)
df_cor2 = covidcast_cor(df_fb2_act, df_in_act, by = &quot;time_value&quot;,
                        method = &quot;spearman&quot;)

# Stack rowwise into one data frame, then plot time series
df_cor = rbind(df_cor1, df_cor2)
df_cor$signal = c(rep(&quot;% CLI&quot;, nrow(df_cor1)),
                  rep(&quot;% CLI-in-community&quot;, nrow(df_cor2)))

                          case_num), x = &quot;Date&quot;, y = &quot;Correlation&quot;) +

<p><img src="/blog/post/2020-08-26-fb-survey_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.svg" width="576" /></p>
<p>Another interesting observation is that the correlations from either indicator
increase dramatically sometime around mid-June.
This could be because many counties saw big surges in COVID-19 activity around
that time. These surges created a larger spread between the COVID-19 case rates
across the country, and so county-to-county differences started to become easier
to track with the indicators, as the magnitude of these differences started to
swamp the noise.</p>
<p>Of course, this is really just speculation,
and we can’t say for certain that this is the cause.
Some decent empirical evidence for our explanation, however, can be found
by looking at how COVID-19 case rates vary between counties over time, as shown
below. The median absolute deviation (a robust measure of spread) between
counties rises sharply sometime around mid-June,
around the same time as the correlations increased.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(df_in_act %&gt;% group_by(time_value) %&gt;%
         summarize(mad = mad(value, na.rm = TRUE)),
       aes(x = time_value, y = mad)) + geom_line() +
  labs(title = &quot;Median absolute deviation in COVID-19 case rates&quot;,
       subtitle = sprintf(&quot;Over all counties with at least %i cumulative cases&quot;,
                          case_num), x = &quot;Date&quot;, y = &quot;Median abs deviation&quot;) +
  theme_bw() </code></pre>

</div>
<div id="correlations-sliced-by-county" class="section level3">
<h3>Correlations Sliced by County</h3>
<p>Next we compute, for each county with at least 500 cumulative cases,
the Spearman correlations between each of our indicators and COVID-19 case
rates, across all time. We can visualize this in a few different ways.
Below we plot estimated densities from these two sets of correlations:
from the % CLI indicator in red, and the % CLI-in-community indicator in blue.
With this slice of the data (correlations by county, rather than by day),
we again see that the % CLI-in-community indicator produces <em>much</em> higher
correlations.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Compute correlations, per county, over all time
df_cor1 = covidcast_cor(df_fb1_act, df_in_act, by = &quot;geo_value&quot;)
df_cor2 = covidcast_cor(df_fb2_act, df_in_act, by = &quot;geo_value&quot;)

# Stack rowwise into one data frame, then plot densities
df_cor = rbind(df_cor1, df_cor2)
df_cor$signal = c(rep(&quot;% CLI&quot;, nrow(df_cor1)),
                  rep(&quot;% CLI-in-community&quot;, nrow(df_cor2)))
ggplot(df_cor, aes(value)) +
  geom_density(aes(color = signal, fill = signal), alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = ggplot_colors[c(3,1)]) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = ggplot_colors[c(3,1)]) +
  labs(title = &quot;Correlation between CLI signals and case rates&quot;,
       subtitle = sprintf(&quot;Over all counties with at least %i cumulative cases&quot;,
                          case_num), x = &quot;Correlation&quot;, y = &quot;Density&quot;) +
  theme_bw() + theme(legend.pos = &quot;bottom&quot;, legend.title = element_blank())</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blog/post/2020-08-26-fb-survey_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.svg" width="576" /></p>
<p>We can also examine choropleth maps of these correlations to learn
where (geographically speaking) they’re high and where they’re not.
As we can see from the maps below, the % CLI-in-community indicator
yields high correlations throughout much of the US,
whereas the % CLI indicator is a bit more spotty.
Note that here a gray color denotes a missing value:
either that county had below 500 cumulative COVID-19 cases,
or we didn’t have enough data from the surveys in
order to estimate % CLI and % CLI-in-community signals there.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Set a bunch of fields so that the data frames know how to plot themselves
df_cor1$time_value = df_cor2$time_value = start_day
df_cor1$issue = df_cor2$issue = start_day
attributes(df_cor1)$metadata$geo_type = &quot;county&quot;
attributes(df_cor2)$metadata$geo_type = &quot;county&quot;
class(df_cor1) = class(df_cor2) = c(&quot;covidcast_signal&quot;, &quot;data.frame&quot;)

<div id="whats-next-with-the-surveys" class="section level2">
<h2>What’s Next with the Surveys</h2>
<p>You might expect that a survey that reaches tens of thousands of respondents
within the US daily—and has done so for months during a major pandemic—could
have <em>many</em> possible uses beyond simply surveying symptoms. You would be right.
Beyond the first section on the core COVID symptoms, our survey contains
questions on testing, behavior, medical care, mental health, and related topics,
opening a multitude of possible research questions up to empirical inquiry.</p>
<p>This is why Delphi and the University of Maryland (for the international
version) offer direct access to the survey data to academic and non-profit
researchers, who agree to data use terms (requiring, for one, that researchers
don’t attempt to identify respondents and don’t release individual survey
responses, only averages and other aggregates). So far, over a dozen research
groups sought and received access to our survey data, and are using it to study
various aspects of the pandemic. We’re actively seeking researchers studying
important public health problems to apply for access through a <a href="https://dataforgood.fb.com/docs/covid-19-symptom-survey-request-for-data-access/">form managed by
Facebook</a>,
and our goal is to build a network of researchers committed to fighting the
pandemic through our survey data.</p>
<p>To take these efforts to the next level, we’ll soon release a new version of the
survey. Based on feedback from other researchers, public health agencies, the
University of Maryland, and Facebook, we’ve added items asking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>More details on COVID testing (including whether the respondent tried to get
tested but could not).</li>
<li>Mask wearing.</li>
<li>The types of activities the respondent has done with other people.</li>
<li>Mental health and social isolation.</li>
<li>Employment.</li>
<li>Demographics (including race and education).</li>
</ul>
<p>These items will give us an unprecedented view into
how people have responded to the pandemic,
how they have been affected by the pandemic and the resulting economic downturn,
and how specific groups are affected.
We hope the mask and behavior items can help researchers studying
how best to prevent the spread of COVID-19,
and can even help inform forecasts,
while mental health and isolation items will help researchers to understand
how social distancing and recession have affected mental health.
Together with extended demographic data, this may help to inform policies
designed to help those most affected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>This new survey is currently being deployed,
and data should become available in the next few weeks.
Detailed data will be available to researchers,
while new aggregates—such as of mask-wearing—will
be made public, as usual, through our <a href="https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html">COVIDcast
API</a>
and <a href="https://covidcast.cmu.edu/">COVIDcast interactive map</a>.</p>
